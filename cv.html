			<p class="text-center">Hi, I'm Andy and I'm a self-taught front-end developer. I have a good understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I continue to learn new things and improve constantly. I'm looking for a role that will support my development and challenge me to become a better developer. 
			I believe I have many transferable skills from my current career that will be of value: team-work, attention to detail and dealing with clients including senior business executives daily. Above all I'll bring a willingness and desire to learn.</p>

			<h5>Aviva – General Insurance</h5>
			<p><u>Distribution Manager (January 2019 – Ongoing)</u></p>
			<p>My role is to manage and develop the relationship between Aviva and its brokers, gaining an understanding of their business and working with them to profitably grow their accounts in a way that is mutually beneficial. Internally we are seen as the voice of our brokers and therefore excellent communication with all stakeholders is imperative. 
			<br>I’ve been lucky enough to collaborate with some excellent teams including pitching for an £800k scheme, handling the full process from identifying the opportunity, understanding what was required and working internally to achieve a proposition that met my brokers needs. I then delivered the pitch and secured the business.</p>
